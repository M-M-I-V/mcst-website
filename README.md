# MCST Official Website

This is the official website of **Mandaluyong College of Science and Technology (MCST)**. It was developed using a modern front-end tech stack, and is designed for clarity, responsiveness, and maintainability.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript** – Component-based UI development with static typing
- **Vite** – Fast development and build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
- **Shadcn UI** – Accessible, headless UI components
- **AOS (Animate on Scroll)** – Smooth scroll-based animations
- **Git + GitHub** – Version control and deployment

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mcst-website.git
cd mcst-website

2. Install Dependencies

npm install

3. Run in Development Mode

npm run dev

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173.

---

🏗️ Build for Production

npm run build

The production-ready files will be generated in the dist/ folder.

---

## 🌐 Deployment & Setup on Windows

You can set up the project in two ways:

---

### ✅ Option 1: `git clone` (Recommended)

Best for development — full Git tracking.

#### 📌 Initial Setup

Open Git Bash and set your Git identity:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

You can verify with:

git config --list

🚀 Clone the Project

1. Open Git Bash


2. Navigate to your folder:

cd /c/Users/YourName/Documents


3. Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo


✅ You can now use:

git pull
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main  # or master

---

⚠️ Option 2: Download ZIP

Good for quick viewing — not for active development.

Steps:

1. Go to your GitHub repo

2. Click Code > Download ZIP

3. Extract the ZIP


If you want to use Git commands later:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

---

🔀 If You Forked the Repo

✅ Fork + Clone (Recommended)

1. Fork the repo on GitHub


2. Clone your fork:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-repo.git
cd the-repo


You're ready to push:

git add .
git commit -m "Changes"
git push origin main

---

❌ Fork + Download ZIP

This gives you a code snapshot — no Git tracking. You’ll need to run:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/the-repo.git

---

👨‍🔧 Maintenance Guide

Update content by editing files inside:

src/pages/ – for individual pages like About, Admission, Programs, etc.

src/components/ – for shared components like Header, Footer, CTA, etc.


To reflect changes:

1. Run npm run build

2. Redeploy the contents of the dist/ folder
